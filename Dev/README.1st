In order to develop with the current system, do the following.

*   Edit the file lox.asm with your code.

*   Run 'goldie lox.asm' to assemble this file into a machine image
    file ('corestate.myst') which contains the resulting object code.
    This image is created in the current folder and contains
    the complete state of the machine, including the registers, flags,
    64k of memory, etc.

    The assembler also creates the file 'lox_debug.txt' with
    an ASCII concordance of object code vs. source code.

*   You can single-step the machine with the 'lox -s' command,
    and you can dump/visualize its registers using 'lox -r'.

*   When run with any other input arguments, the 'lox' tool copies
    its command line arguments into the machine's memory,
    concatenating them into
    a list of zero-terminated strings starting at address 0x7F80.
    It then runs the machine image file.

    During execution, the firmware can write ASCII text into a
    dedicated buffer area (output buffer) from 0x7F00 to 0x7F7F.

    Then at some point, the machine executes the application-specific
    instruction END, to signal that it wants to quit and return to
    the command line.
    Before exiting, 'lox' persists the machine state into the
    machine image file.

    In effect, 'lox' turns the machine into a command line tool:
    Arguments are passed over to native code by copying them into the
    input buffer, and the output buffer is copied to the terminal
    when the code exits.
    In addition, data structures created or any other modifications
    are preserved in 'corestate_myst' and can be continued by running
    'lox' again.

Note:
The emulation code used to simulate the Myth CPU is in 'myth.h'.
