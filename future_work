As of December 2023, I haven't any plans to continue experimenting with this particular hardware.
It was more a proof-of-concept that this controller is small enough to be built discretely.
I am currently writing firmware for a software emulator of this CPU.
The architecture I use going forward has changed slightly, but significantly:
1. xJ, xT and xE (jump instructions) change the PC (low order) instead of branching to banks
(and setting the PC to zero).
2. Also, X and Y have been renamed to L and H (for low and high program counter).
3. The address mapping has been simplified: any fetch instruction uses the PC high register,
and is ignoring the Global/Local mapping, so that the segment size is the full 256 bytes
when accessing the code stream.
The next step after bootstrapping a native assembler within the firmware project
will be a Verilog/FPGA version.
