As of December 2023, I haven't any plans to continue experimenting with this particular hardware, but who knows.
It was a proof-of-concept that this controller really is small enough to be built discretely.
I am currently writing firmware for a software emulator for this CPU.
The architecture I use going forward has changed slightly, but significantly:
1. xJ, xT and xE (jump instructions) now change the PC (low order) instead of branching to banks
(and setting the PC to zero).
2. Also, X and Y have been renamed to L and H (for low and high program counter).
3. The address mapping has been simplified: any fetch instruction uses the PC high register,
and is ignoring the Global/Local mapping, so that the segment size is the full 256 bytes
when accessing the code stream.
The next step after bootstrapping a native assembler within the firmware project
will be a Verilog/FPGA version.

This folder contains a modified assembler, crummy and sketchy as it should be. But it does assemble the multiplication example.
Run the assembler first, then run the emulator. The multiplication result shows up as the first byte (G0) of the Global section.
