            <p>The parts that are currently covered are the instruction opcodes
              (section <a href="groups.html">Groups</a>) and the <a href="com.html">IO system</a>.

            There exists a fully working physical version of this micro-controller
            built with 74HC series CMOS chips. The production files
            for the PCB can be found in the 'Prototype' folder of
            the GitHub repo.</p>
        <p>
            This
            <a href="https://github.com/Dosflange/Myth/blob/main/Prototype/Multiply%20demo.MOV">video</a>
            shows a custom IO board piggy-backed on the micro-controller board
            running a program on the press of a button.
            The program boots from a serial EEProm (using a native routine),
            multiplies two numbers and outputs the result on a 7-Segment display.
            No other stored program logic other than the Myth controller
            was used.
            The prototype has been donated to Crashspace in Culver City for parts in October of 2023.
        </p>
        <p>
          A hardware board conforming to the final version of the design
          has not been produced yet, and the <a href="static/myth.pdf">schematics<a/> are
          out of synch with the working hardware and need review and debugging.
          The current
          <a href="https://github.com/Dosflange/Myth/blob/main/Schematics/myth.kicad_sch">KiCad file</a>
          uses exactly 100 chips, including 'glue' such as inverters etc.
