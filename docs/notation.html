          <h2>Assembler Notation and Conventions</h2>
          <p>
            Bit positions are numbered starting from 0 (LSB - least significant bit) to 7 (MSB), usually with the letter 'b' for 'bit' prefixed.
            Single uppercase letters refer to registers when used in the text. Instruction mnemonics use lowercase.
          </p>
          <h2>Page, Offset, Pointer</h2>
          <p>The word 'Page' refers to the high-order address byte,
            an 'Offset' is the low-order byte, and a full 16-bit address
            is a 'Pointer' in this project.
            The word pointer is mostly used in the context of a register
            pair in which one register holds a page index, and
            the other one a byte offset to within that page, such as D:O, C:PC, or L:O, or D:I.
          </p>
          <h2>Comments</h2>
          <p>
            Place comments into parentheses (nesting is not implemented). A semicolon (";") as the first character of a line works as a line comment.
          </p>
          <h2>Phrasing</h2>
          <p>
            Multiple assembler mnemonics can occur on a single line. Commas (",") can optionally be used for grouping "phrases" of instructions that logically belong together. They don't generate code and are just for visual clarity.
          </p>
          <h2>Number Literals</h2>
          <p>
            Decimal numbers from 0-255 can be included in the source text as literals,
            and be prefixed by an optional minus sign.
            Hexadecimal numbers must be in two uppercase digits and marked with the suffix "h", for instance: "80h" for 128.
            Binary numbers can either be formatted as four numeric digits with the suffic "b" (1111b = 15), or in the following way,
            as two 4-bit groups separated by an underscore ("_") with the suffix "b", for instance: "0010_0000b" for 32.
          </p>
          <h2>Strings and Characters</h2>
          <p>Characters enclosed in double quotation marks such as "Hello World" are assembled to strings of characters.</p>
          <h2>Page Labels</h2>
          <p>
            P[label] defines a label with the page index of the object code pointer as its value.
            P[label]index does the same, but also sets the page index of the pointer to 'index'.
            P[label]+ defines label as before, advances the page index of the pointer by 1 and sets the offset position to zero.
            Page indices can be targets of CALL and TRAP instructions. They can be used as literals anywhere in the code.
          </p>
          <h2>Offset Labels</h2>
          <p>
            O[label] defines a label with the offset of the object code pointer as its value.
            O[label]offset does the same, but also sets the offset of the pointer to 'offset'.
            Offset labels can be jumped to, or they can represent address offsets within a page.
          </p>
          <h2>Trap Labels</h2>
          <p>
            An asterisk placed before a page label encodes a trap call instruction to that address.
            Such label references will generate an opcode that will trigger a TRAP and call the handler function referenced by the label.
          </p>
          <h2>Constants</h2>
          <p>P[label]value defines a constant.</p>
          <h2>Label References</h2>
          <p>
            Page and offset labels are referenced by prefixing their identifier with "&lt;" (for backward references, i.e. the label is defined earlier in the source code than the reference to it), or with "&gt;" (forward reference, i.e. the label is defined later than the reference to it in the source code). If a label is not unique, the reference goes to the nearest occurrence of it in the given direction. A label reference is just a numerical value and can be used as a literal anywhere in the code.
          </p>
          <h2>Local variable shortcuts (DIRO)</h2>
          <p>
            Examples: r0 ("PUT R into local var L0"), 4o ("GET O from local var L4").
