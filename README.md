Ongoing project around an 8-bit microcontroller I designed.

A working hardware implementation using 74HC-series CMOS chips (folder "Prototype") has been built using KiCad.

The PCB is shown below.

The work in the "Schematics" folder is based on the KiCad file used for PCB production.

The design has changed substantially though, and the schematics - although true to the current model - will need revision!
