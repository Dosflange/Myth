Welcome to this project!

This repo contains all files you need to build and program a CPU that I have designed.

You would need to have the two PCBs fabricated: Firstly, there's the CPU board itself.
It is actually a micro-controller, in that this board implements RAM and an IO interface.
Then secondly, there is an IO expansion board, that fits on top of the CPU board via Arduino type stackable headers.

The CPU board looks like this:

These plastic spacers go between the CPU board and the IO board. The distance/length of the spacer part (without the protruding thread) is 2 cm.

Both modules go together like so:
