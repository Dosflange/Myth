Welcome to this project!

This repo contains all files you need to build and program a CPU that I have designed.

You would need to have the two PCBs fabricated: Firstly, there's the CPU board itself.
It is actually a micro-controller, in that this board implements RAM and an IO interface.
Then secondly, there is an IO expansion board, that fits on top of the CPU board via Arduino type stackable headers.
